gtresurrection.quest0.desc=This pack is mainly focused on well known mod §bGregTech§r, that recently got ported to version 1.12.2 with acronym §bGTCE§r meaning Community Edtion.\n \nThis brought me to idea of making this pack that implements mods along side of GT using similar recipe structure to make progression a bit harder. There are many mods you may know from other modpacks however with significantly different recipes and behavior.\n \nAny issues or questsions encountered during gampley can be discussed on §cCurseForge§r modpack's issues tab or at our official §1Discord§r server.\n \nHope you will enjoy this pack and don't forget to tell friends about this pack. \n§4Good luck you're going to need it!
